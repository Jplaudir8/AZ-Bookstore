# AZ-Bookstore

This project consists of a Single-Page Application with several increments in which I will continuosly be adding different things such as the Vue framework, java code for the back-end side of the app and also some refactoring on the front-end side to make this app responsive.
### Bookstore
This folder contains only the client side of the application. This was the first increment developed for the application, hence it also only contains pure HTML and CSS.

### Bookstore_Vue
This folder contains the second increment of the development. Consists of the front-end side of the application where the html and css files have been translated into Vue JS components. Also here we added the server side of the application which is built with Java (No Frameworks).

#### Additional Details
This Application has been developed using Vue 2 (with the current latest 14.x.x LTS version of Node) and ran on top of Apache 9.0.53
